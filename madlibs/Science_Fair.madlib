According to ((principal:a school principal's name)), the school science fair this year was 'very educational.' At the same time, ((principal)) announced plans to quit the school system and become a ((a dangerous job)). 'It sounds like a safer job,' the principal said.

Several ((an adjective)) projects were disqualified this year. The experiment on 'Animal Magnetism' by ((a girl's name)) was canceled before she could plug in her ((an animal)).

The project by ((a male bully's name)) on 'Gravity's Effect on First Graders' was canceled when the custodians wouldn't let him borrow a ladder.

And the Nuclear Powered ((a noun)) built by ((name:a proper noun)) was taken away by the police, who said ((name)) will be back in school 'any day now.'

((your name)) won second prize with an experiment that asked, 'Can ((animals:a plural animal)) Learn Karate?' The answer was 'yes.' The ((animals)) tossed ((principal)) over a ((a noun)) and left the science fair. Anyone who sees them should call the main office.

((a girl's name)) won first prize with her TNT ((veggies:a plural vegetable)).  By planting seeds in gunpowder and watering them with nitroglycerin, ((veggies)) grew that explode when you drop them. 'What a dynamite idea,' the principal joked ((an adverb)).
