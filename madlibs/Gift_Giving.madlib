For my ((a family member))'s ((an event)) present about ((a number)) years ago,
I got him a ((gift:a noun)).   Not a ((an adjective)) ((gift)) or a loud one or
even a ((an adjective)) ((gift)) that runs around chasing its ((a body part))
and drooling on the ((a noun)).  I got them a ((a proper noun)), bred in China
thousands of years ago to be the ((a plural noun)) of the royal family.  We
named it ((a proper name)).
